# my neovim config

this config uses nvchad mainly to organize and get nice themes by default and improves upon it by introducing new features utilizing plugins that I deem necessary.
This is still under progress and still have much work to do :)

Let's goooo

## to do

- [ ] project and session management maintaining tabs
- [ ] test it in linux
- [ ] build tasks and test tasks easy implementation
- [ ] make the VSCode integration removable
- [ ] proper LaTeX setup with tectonic
- [ ] potential zellij integration

## long term goals

- platformio setup
- ghostty integration
- moving to neovim 10

<!-- - K is mapped to LSP highlight -->
- <leader>gg to get lazygit
- <leader>fp to navigate projects
